\begin{itemize}
    \item Scheduled, planned, and executed all test plan process templates and schedules for subsystem-level flight hardware. Managed the inventory catalogs, work orders, test logs, and maintenance and calibration schedules for all equipment, parts, and flight hardware.
    \item Served as the primary Component Test Lab Cost Account Manager (CAM), overseeing all cost reporting. Analyzed and reported flight unit work orders and hours per unit (HPU) charged to each program account weekly, aligning with program budgets, commitments, and schedules. Prepared and presented relevant metrics and reports for Program Management during weekly and monthly status meetings, utilizing Tableau, SAP, and a MySQL-configured internal database.
    \item Collaborated with cross-functional teams to resolve issues, align processes, reconcile data, and continuously improve overall cost center work performance and test operation efficiencies.
    \item Facilitated component test lab quality review boards, addressing defects and implementing corrective actions for operator errors. Managed non-conformance reporting within the lab and test bays. Spearheaded the documentation of Root Cause and Corrective Actions (RCCAs) and engaged in 5-Why's analysis, contributing to Program Quality Assurance Review Boards.
    \item Created and managed an internal Program SharePoint and a Linux MySQL site. Played a pivotal role in integrating Atlassian's Jira and Confluence platforms into the sector, promoting Agile Methodology Best Practices adoption among our teams.

\role {Raytheon Missile Systems}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Led cross-functional teams as the night shift supervisor for various Special Access Programs (SAPs) within a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), overseeing production and key delivery schedules. 
    \item Managed timecards, labor costs, and work assignments. Coordinated planning, scheduling, and task reporting within SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and SAP Manufacturing Operations Software. 
    \item Ensured operators were well-equipped for success by providing necessary resources, training, and tools, while maintaining a safe, positive, and collaborative work environment.
    \item Interfaced with Program and Operations Management for weekly schedule and contractual program requirement updates. This required managing the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for Program Management, which entailed the overall planning, scheduling, coordinating, and reporting tasks in support of the IMS to meet all Quarterly Delivery Milestones for Program customers.
    \item Implemented Lean Manufacturing principles and integrated Continuous Improvement efforts throughout all stages of product operations and life cycles. This initiative involved transitioning the product lines' Kanban operations board from a traditional whiteboard with magnets to a comprehensive digital tracking system. The advanced system was designed to interface seamlessly with SAP Shop Floor Software and featured a custom Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Graphical User Interface (GUI). Undertaking this upgrade within a SCIF Closed Area, for a SCI/SAP classified program, presented unique challenges. This solution was not only secure and modern but also compliant with the stringent security protocols and processes mandated by our client, our business organization, and industry standards.
    \item Enhanced the overall visualization of process flow and productivity, enabling real-time tracking of all build, inspect, and test operations. This enhancement increased visibility and fostered team collaboration, leading to greater efficiency. It also facilitated the elimination of defects and idle time between operations, and enabled cross-training of operators, optimizing the use of their time and skills.

\datedsubsection{\textbf{\textit{Hardware Quality Engineer}}} {\textbf{Aug 2016 \textasciitilde \ May 2018}}
\role {Raytheon Missile Systems}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Received the RMS QMA Top Talent Quality Professional award in 2017 for submitting the most successful continuous improvement project for the Javelin Joint-Venture (JV) Missile Systems Program. 
    \item The Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ) reduction project on the Javelin JV Program yielded significant savings of over 350k (dollars) for FY2017. This success was attributed to a decrease in defects, the elimination of rework, a reduction in TAKT time, and enhanced efficiency of process flow operations. The initiative involved phasing out an outdated procedure that applied a hot melt coat to shield test connectors on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) before the application of their protective coating.
    \item Received the Raytheon QMA Strategic Error Proofing Quarterly Award in 2018 for spearheading a project that focused on Verifiable Process Controls (VPC's) for test processes. The project was so successful that the framework was implemented sector-wide across several different programs within RMS with great success.
    \item The project framework, centered on Statistical Process Control (SPC) test data, specifically targets production unit test 'pCodes' (partition codes). These pCodes track and measure the overall test performance, focusing on the health of the hardware (production units) and the condition of the test equipment, based on its performance. It was already a contractual requirement for each program to identify key pCodes, composed of Key Product Characteristics (KPCs) critical to the hardware's function and performance, and to monitor and analyze them weekly. Although each program had accumulated years of such data, containing a wealth of information, most of it remained unutilized, except for the main KPI key pCodes established at the program's inception, which were unlikely to change significantly over the program's lifecycle. My project framework aimed to leverage all the underutilized existing data, and model it alongside key event data linked to unit serial numbers. This included defect reports for each unit, metrology calibration records of the test equipment, and any software change records occurring in the same time frame. Over time, the framework assessed how various external variables impacted pCode performance, providing a cause-and-effect analysis that could predict events before they occurred, based on historical data and the current state of the hardware and test equipment. This approach resulted in fewer process escapes, reduced test defects, and improved maintenance of test equipment.
    \item Successfully led teams through containment and elimination plans utilizing Root Cause Analysis (RCA) tools, including Sologic Root Cause Analysis Software, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEAs), Fault Tree Analysis, A3 Problem Solving Matrix, and various other Quality Assurance tools.
    \item Facilitated several Corrective Action (CA) plans that led to successful acceptance by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).
    \item Completed several program First Article Inspections (FAIs) for new builds and supplied parts for both new and updated processes.
